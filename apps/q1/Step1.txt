1. There are 32 semaphores in DLXOS.
2. There are 64 locks available.
3. SemCreate is called and given a count number. It then initializes a semaphore and returns its pointer.
4. Sem_wait inserts the semaphore into a queue for waiting, assuming there is room in the queue and that the input is a semaphore. Sem_signal wakes up the semaphore from the queue and then removes it from the queue.
5. A handle is how you access a semaphore in dlxos. It allows you to access what state it is in and how it is being used.
